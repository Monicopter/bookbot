# bookbot

BookBot is my first project!
Guided project through Boot.dev @monicopter


Takes a text (frankenstein.txt in this case) and performs sorts through it to collect statistics, then prints a report to the console:

-Finds word count
-Finds letter frequency
-Sorts letter frequency in descending order
-Prints a neat book report of findings to console
